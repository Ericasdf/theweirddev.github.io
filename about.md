Hello, I am Samuel Masue software developer in Switzerland, Geneva area. I have a background in Java and I am keen on
 new
technologies.

Last year I was fully dedicated to a new project in my company around the solution Alfresco.
I spent many and many days extending and customizing it. Today I would like to share my experience and who
knows it might help someone.
