Hello, I am Samuel Masue software developer in Switzerland, Geneva area. I have a background in Java and
I am keen on new technologies. I consider myself as a tech guy!

Last year I was full-time dedicated to a new project in my company around the solution Alfresco. 
I spent many and many days extending and customizing Alfresco. Today I would like to share a bit my experience in this blog.
