Hello, I am Samuel Masue software developer currently holding a position in Switzerland, Geneva area. I have a java background and
I am keen on new technologies. I consider myself as a tech guy !

Last year I was full-time dedicated to a new project in my company around the solution Alfresco. 
I spent many and many days extending and customizing the solution Alfresco. Today I would like to share a bit my experience in this blog.
