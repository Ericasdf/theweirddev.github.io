For some cases the out-of-the-box permissions in Alfresco does not fit exactly our needs. However it is not a hard to
 extend them. In this post, we will see the basics extension with one use case. We will how to add a permission
 group which will contain the same permissions as a n Editor but in addition will contain Delete permissions.

## Theory

http://docs.alfresco.com/4.0/concepts/secur-permissions.html

To start with permission there is one file to look at it, permissionDefinitions.xml. It is the main configuration
file. there is another one which is sitePermissionDefinitions.xml which contains the configurations for the sites
permissions.

Extending permissions it's actually writing such xml files.
- Permission
  - has a name, should start with underscore.
  - may be granted to any number of permission groups.
  -
- Permission Group
  - groups permissions and permission groups together
- Permissions Set
