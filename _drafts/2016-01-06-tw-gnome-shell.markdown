Lately I've been playing with the gnome-shell extension. I wanted to create mine and I came up with a result. The experience was a bit painful.
This post will present the simple extension I have, I will provide explanation whenever I can. However this should taken with carefulness and not
as the absolute truth since I've start with few days ago.

Nevertheless the extension is pretty simple and I think it can help someone (probably me at first).
